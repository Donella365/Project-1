# Building A Virtual Home Network

## Objective

Building a virtual home network with Cisco Packet Tracer. 
The primary focus of this hands-on experience was to deepen my understanding of network security and virtually craete things that I've studied. 

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of segmentation, micro-segmentation, isolation. 
- Network design and north and south bound traffic. 
- Defense in depth. Endpoint Security.  
- Zero trust architecture. Privacy by design. Network topologies. 
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer to build the network.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.

## Steps
Download Cisco Packet Tracer

Connect the devices...Connect the wireless home router to the PC.

For the laptop we want to do wireless, but the laptop comes with a wired card here.

Turn off the Laptop, remove the wired card & put in a wireless interface (WPC300N). Then turn the laptop back on. Now we can do a wireless connection.

The Laptop is now connected wirelessly.

Now for the Webcam, the port status was off and the SSIDs were different by default.

So I turned on port status and matched the SSIDs.

Now the IoT webcam is connected wirelessly.
